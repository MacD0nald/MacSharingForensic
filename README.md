# Mac Sharing Forensic

## Purpose

As MacOS versions continue to emerge, this tool allows users to collect differentiated artifacts generated by interworking between iDevices and iDevices related to file sharing that are different in paths from existing versions and other OSs, and show them in an easy-to-see form of output. Mac Sharing Forensic can be run against a live system
